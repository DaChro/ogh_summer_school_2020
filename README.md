# Material for the session "Introduction to Deep Learning in R for the analysis of UAV-based remote sensing data"

*OpenGeoHub summer school 2020*


# Installation

Install a current version of R and the following packages:

`install.packages(c("keras","tfdatasets","mapview","stars","rsample","gdalUtils","purrr", "magick", "jpeg"))`

Install miniconda, keras and tensorflow python dependencies:

- `reticulate::install_miniconda()`
- `keras::install_keras()`

To check if everything works:

- `reticulate::py_config()`
- `tensorflow::tf_config()`
- `keras::is_keras_available()`


For installing dependencies of rgdal, stars and magick on linux:

- gdal:`sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev`

- stars: `sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev`

- magick: `sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev`

# Docker

If you are in for using Docker, IÂ´ve prepared a Docker image that includes all software and data for the tutorial, so you can reproduce the tutorial without installing keras etc. on your host system. If you want to use it, download and install Docker Engine:

- Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository
- Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
- Mac: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

Then:

- start Docker Engine
- in your terminal (or power shell) type: `docker run -d -p 8788:8787 dachro/oghss:latest`
    - `8788` on the left side of the `:` is the port on your host system. You can use any other available port that your prefer
- after the container has been built and started, open you browers and go to `localhost:8788/` (or whatever port you have chosen)
- you should see the rstudio server login page. Log in via username: rstudio and password: rstudio
